# Data Analysis Project: Health & Safety KAP Study – Cocoa Board, Tema

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves the data cleaning and transformation of questionnaire responses collected as part of a Master's research at **Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)**. The study aimed to assess **Organizational Health and Safety Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)** among staff at the **Cocoa Marketing Company – Tema Takeover Centre**, under the Ghana Cocoa Board.

The original questionnaire was administered by **Lawrence Kwame Adjei**, an MSc Environmental Science student at KNUST. I supported the data analysis process to help transform and prepare the dataset for insights.

## 🔧 What I Did

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
  Recoded categorical responses into numerical codes for analysis.  
  For example:  
  - `Sex: Male = 1, Female = 2`  
  - Similar encoding was applied to other categorical variables like education level, years of service, etc.

- **Structured Dataset**  
  Organized the cleaned data into a tabular format suitable for statistical analysis using tools like R and Excel.

> ⚠️ *Note:* Unfortunately, due to technical issues, the visualizations (charts and summaries) generated during the project were lost. However, the cleaned and coded dataset has been preserved and included in this repository.

## 📁 Repository Contents

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is part of my growing **data analysis portfolio**. It showcases my ability to work with real-world research data, apply data transformation techniques, and support academic and professional research projects. It is intended for potential employers, collaborators, and fellow researchers interested in applied data analysis in the field of public health, occupational safety, and environmental studies.
